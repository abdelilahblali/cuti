                Finally, if you wish to send us any comments or questions, each page of your D2 presentation is displayed below and may be annotated.
                <br>
                We will then answer you (as far as possible) directly on this platform, and any modifications to the 3D will be discussed and carried out during the meeting with the architect.",
